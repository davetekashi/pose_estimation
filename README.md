# This is a pose estimation project that runs on a CPU.
# I made use of openCV and mediapipe for getting the the pose estimation
# The program processes an individual or individuals in a video and then creates a dummy entity that acts out all the pose on a different screen
# This is a project I want to use for a gym I am part
# The program will get the pose estimation of the gym instyructor doing a sit-up and then with that everyone in the gym can knowif their own pose for the sit up is correct
# Not just sit-ups, every single other excercise which includes Yoga and Others.
